What to obtain at the HOTEL?

•If the hotel has agreed to a full refund on a penalized or non-refundable booking, ask for cancellation number, folio, front desk name and position.

•If the hotel says they cannot provide a folio or that the folio is blank simply advise the hotel to send an email to Folio@hotelplanner.com
•Please ask that the email includes; Guest first and last name, and the message “this reservation was cancelled free of charge/ without penalty“.


BILLING AND REFUND TICKET
“We will be raising a ticket for our Tickets Team to review your concern. They will be reaching out to you as soon as possible through your email. May I confirm your email address. Is it _________?”

•For some scenarios the guest insists on having the refund immediately, advise the guest that “We will escalate your request (follow escalation matrix). We advise that it may take 2-10 business days depending on your bank.”
•For some scenarios that guest insists on having the voucher immediately (Check the FIT to see if voucher was issued). Immediate voucher requests should only be made for same-day re-bookings where hotel denied lodging or agent error.  For same day check-in re-book the guest in a new transaction. (Recommended Pay at Hotel) For guests that will not be checking in on the same day but need to make their next reservation, offer to re-book immediately in a new transaction.

Disputed Reservations
Disputes:

Once a dispute has been opened on a reservation, we are  unable to issue any refund until the dispute has been  closed. Closure of a dispute takes up to 90 days,  but the guest is able to provide written documentation of the closure of the dispute in order to move on to grant a possible  refund.  This is subject to the merchant approval as well.

Our ispute team will then work with our merchant to  get the dispute removed from the booking so that the  Escalations Team can work on obtaining authorization  for any pending refund.

Requests for status updates on disputed reservations  can also be sent to this email – chargereview@hotelplanner.com
How to proceed for Unrecognized Charges
If you CAN ﬁnd the RSV:
Resend a copy of the confirmation via email and text.
If you CANNOT ﬁnd the RSV:
If a Client receives a charge that they do  not recognize and you’re unable to pull up  a RSV with the information provided, ask  them to email Proof of Charge (could  be a screenshot of the charges on their  CC Statement) to:  reservations@hotelplanner.com

Charges without a RSV
If a client calls because they were trying to make a  booking, and they got charged but the reservation wasn’t  completed successfully, you’ll need to advise the client  that if the charge is still Pending it will disappear in the  next 24 - 48 hours. If the charge is Posted after the  48 hours, they will need to send a copy of the charge or  bank statement to reservations@hotelplanner.com.

If at the time of the call, the charge has posted out of  their account, they need to send it right away to the  same email. Please ask the guest to kindly add a brief  explanation of what happened and the screenshot of the  charges.
Unrecognized RSVs
Sometimes, you’ll receive a call from a Client that received a text message notiﬁcation conﬁrming a RSV. Whenever this  happens, validate the information on the RSV and conﬁrm with the Guest if they receive a charge to their CC related to that RSV.

If the Client has been charged for it, and the email on  the RSV does not belong to them, you can ask them to  submit	the	screenshot	of	the	charges	to		our  reservations@hotelplanner.com		email	adding	the  details of the RSV to easily identify it. 
If the Guet hasn’t been charged, verify the phone  number in our RSV is the same as the guests.  Advise them the information received was sent in error to their phone number .
Duplicate Charges
Sometimes, you’ll receive a call from a Guest that has been charged multiple times for the same reservations or the hotel has charged the guest a second time for a prepaid reservation.  When this happens,  please request a screenshot of both charges to be replied to the ticket that will be created by using the “Double Charge” dropdown.
